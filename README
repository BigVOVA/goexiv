Go bindings for exiv2 (http://www.exiv2.org)

Those bindings are at the moment (very) incomplete, but already allow you to
read the metadata of a file, and get the EXIF fields out of it. Binding coverage
will be extended as I start needing more methods (or receiving more pull
requests :) ).

Note: Because Exiv2 is a C++ library, you probably need Go 1.2 to benefit from
the improved C++ support in CGO.
